📁 Context File for Cursor Folder: Advertising Competition Game
📝 Project Overview
This is a web-based Advertising Competition Game designed as part of a Game Theory project. The game simulates an advertising campaign where players allocate their budget strategically to maximize Reach and ROI (Return on Investment).

Players must select a target audience and pair them with an ad channel, ensuring they optimize their spending to meet campaign goals. The game progresses over three rounds, each increasing in complexity.

🌟 Game Structure
✅ Round 1: Base Mechanics (Already Implemented)
Objective: Allocate a ₹30,000 budget to reach as many people as possible while achieving an ROI of at least 5,000.

Gameplay:

Choose a Target Audience (Teenagers, Adults, Seniors).

Choose an Ad Channel (Social Media, TV Ads, Billboards).

Drag and drop audience-ad pairings into three Campaign Slots.

UI Components:

Budget Indicator

ROI Progress Bar

Target Audience & Ad Channels Panel

Campaign Strategy Slots

Round Status & Progress Panel

Strategy Tips Panel

Countdown Timer (2 min per round)

🚀 Round 2: Competition & Budget Complexity
🆕 New Mechanics:
✅ Competitor AI: A simulated competitor also selects ad strategies, competing for audience reach.
✅ Diminishing Returns: Reusing the same strategy lowers effectiveness.
✅ Dynamic Pricing: Ad costs fluctuate based on demand (e.g., TV ads become expensive if overused).

🔹 Changes from Round 1:

Budget Reduced to ₹25,000.

New Audience Segment: Young Professionals (900,000 reach).

Competitor Insights Panel: Shows hints about competitor strategies.

🔥 Round 3: Market Trends & External Events
🆕 New Mechanics:
✅ Market Trends: Certain ad channels get a boost/penalty each round (e.g., "TV Ads are trending among Seniors, increasing effectiveness by 20%").
✅ Random Events: Unexpected disruptions (e.g., "Social Media Outage – Social Media Ads ineffective this round").
✅ Carryover Impact: Previous round’s choices affect this round (e.g., if players overspent on TV Ads, competitors increase their spending there).

🔹 Changes from Round 2:

New Ad Channel: Influencer Marketing (₹12,000, highly engaging but limited reach).

Higher ROI Target: 10,000.

Random Event Indicator Panel added.
